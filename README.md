## üë®‚Äçüíª What I Actually Do

I build AI agents that don't just process text‚Äîthey **have conversations**. Think customer service bots that actually understand context, sales assistants that don't sound like robots, and phone agents that handle complex queries without transferring you to "please hold" purgatory.

### üõ†Ô∏è My Arsenal

```python
tech_stack = {
   "brain_power": ["GPT-4", "Claude", "Custom LLMs", "RAG Pipelines"],
   "voice_magic": ["Twilio", "Vapi", "WebRTC", "ElevenLabs", "Whisper"],
   "backend_muscle": ["FastAPI", "Python", "LangChain", "Vector DBs"],
   "deployment": ["Docker", "AWS", "Real-time Streaming"]
}
