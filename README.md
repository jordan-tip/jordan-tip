# ðŸ‘‹ AI Agent Engineer | Voice AI, Call Agents, LLMs, Prompt Engineering, RAG, Python, Twilio, Vapi, FastAPI ðŸ¤–ðŸ“ž

Hey there â€” welcome! ðŸ™Œ

I'm an **AI engineer** focused entirely on building intelligent agents that *talk back* â€” whether itâ€™s a voice assistant, phone-based agent, or multi-modal AI system.  
Iâ€™ve already built several real-world AI agents that handle natural conversations, automate calls, and solve problems without human help.

### ðŸ§  My Stack Includes:
- **LLMs**, **RAG pipelines**, **Prompt Engineering**
- **Real-time Voice Integration** with tools like:
  - `Twilio`, `Vapi`, `WebRTC`
  - `TTS/STT`, `FastAPI`, `LangChain`, etc.

I love mixing **brains (models)** with **communication (voice/call flow)** to build agents that feel smooth, helpful, and human-ish.

### ðŸš€ About Me:
- Freelancing is a **newer chapter**, but building AI agents is not.
- I bring **battle-tested experience**, **curiosity ðŸ¤“**, and a passion for turning ideas into working products.
- When Iâ€™m not making machines talk, Iâ€™m playing **billiards ðŸŽ±** or tending to **plants ðŸŒ±** â€” both teach patience, timing, and flow.
